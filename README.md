# Text-to-Speech-using-Python

Sometimes we prefer listening to the content instead of reading. We can do multitasking while listening to the critical file data. Python provides many APIs to convert text to speech. The Google Text to Speech API is popular and commonly known as the gTTS API.

It is very easy to use the tool and provides many built-in functions which used to save the text file as an mp3 file.

We don't need to use a neural network and train the model to covert the file into speech, as it is also hard to achieve. Instead, we will use these APIs to complete a task.

The gTTS API provides the facility to convert text files into different languages such as English, Hindi, German, Tamil, French, and many more. We can also play the audio speech in fast or slow mode.

However, as its latest update we cannot change the speech file; it will generate by the system and not changeable.
